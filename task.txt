The desired outcome is a simple application that resembles
production ready software, implementing best-practices, good code hygiene,
enough documentation and reasonably tested code base. Those are attributes
that are going to be valued higher than a complex solution that does not have
them and seems like a work in progress. The solution should be provided via
GitHub.com repository and should include detail instructions on how to run it.

Assignment Overview:
Develop an application that resembles Reddit. Users should be able to start new
Threads and also reply to existing ones. There should also be a way for users to
provide a username. Upvote and downvote functionality will be considered a plus.
All data can be stored in memory. Basic integration tests of the backend endpoints
are expected. Libraries used are up to you, except for the prerequisites. All
additional functionality will also be taken into account.

Prerequisites:
    • Use React for the UI, Javascript and NodeJs for the backend
    • Use Koa for the web server https://koajs.com

Requirements:
    • React app should utilise the backend endpoints to persist the Threads
    • All users should have access to other users Threads and Replies
    • Threads and Replies should be visualised similarly to Reddit

Bonus Points:
    • Full unit and integration tests
    • Persist posts between server restarts
    • Responsive UI
